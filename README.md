# html_vertical_align

A comprehensibe example of vertically aligning the content of an element by using the *.table-cell* CSS property **vertical-align**.
In this example, we will use it to vertically align some text in the entire viewport.

Firstly, we need to create inside the \<body\> a table containing a single table-cell element.

Only for the needs of this example, we need to make sure that the \<table\> inherits the full height of the screen. We achieve this by giving the property *"height:100%"* to the \<html\>, \<body\> and finally the \<table\>.

Lastly, we give the  \<td\> element the property **"vertical-align:middle"** and we put our text element inside it.

Enjoy!
